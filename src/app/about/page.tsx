                Hi my name is <Link href="https://raulduke.com" className="text-green-500 no-underline">Richard √Ålvarez</Link>

                I am a recent college grad who created this tool while prepping for the GRE. I wanted a study aid that was more engaging and effective than the usual, so I built GREasy to make mastering GRE vocabulary both fun and personalized.

                This project is not only about education; it's also about giving back. Fifty percent of proceeds are donated to support humanitarian efforts in Palestine. I believe in the power of education and the importance of helping those in need.

                Thank you for joining us on this journey. I hope that GREasy helps you achieve your GRE goals and makes your study sessions a little brighter. Together, let's make learning fun and impactful!
